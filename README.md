# Hello!
I am a 17-year-old guy who sees the world like a role-playing video game. I'm not all serious with life and I simply live life my way.
## My skills.
I just started programming on Lua, mostly because of Love2D. Been trying to make something secret at the moment, of which I'll show when I make enough progress. (or, feeling cocky here, when I'm complete.)
I actually started trying to code 2 years ago but failed miserably because of my ignorance and lack of motivation. The sucker punch that nailed my failure was when I saw Yanderedev's if/else statement spaghetti, which, humiliatingly, made me paranoid about if/else statements in general.
Two years later however, I've decided to return to my roots, now actively learning new things and even going as far as to go out of my comfort zone to learn some advanced mathematics, which I honestly dislike.
Other than that I'm also an amateur artist and composer. I haven't played nor made art/music in the traditional way though, mostly doing it on computers and phones. (I'm broke.)
And if you ever saw my YouTube channel below, I'm actually making an RPG called Funky Realm, powered by RPG Maker MV. Until my new laptop comes, I won't be able to work on it at the moment though.
Anyway, I'll see you in the foreseeable future for any updates! Bye! =)
